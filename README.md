# ArtyTunes

ArtyTunes is an MVC for getting limited results from spotify data

## Installation

Download the zip file, and run in Visual Studio.  The seed data is under models so it should work without any issue.

## Methodology

I used .NET Framework, because it's the language I'm most comfortable with.  Using the MVC scaffold from VS and the data from the Spotify Tracks Db, I created a very limited application to do some basic queries and display the results.

You can find the Unit Tests under ArtyTunes.Tests.
